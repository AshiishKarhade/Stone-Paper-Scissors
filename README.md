# Stone-Paper-Scissors
Simple stone paper scissors game 

I made this simple and popular stone-paper-scissors game today while sitting on my couch. 

I recently got to knew about the Google's Teachable Machine in which you just can add bunch of class of images and it trains the model for you without any hard coding. I wanted to try it somehow.

### Built With

* [Teachable Machine](http://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) - Teachable Machine
* [Keras](https://keras.io) - Keras.io
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) - Library for images and videos


### Flow
```
1. Open teachable machine website and select the Image Project
2. Add 3 classes for stone, papers and scissors by clicking 500 images of each class
3. Train the model and save it on your local computer
4. Make changes in script.py (model name)
5. run script.py
6. Play the game
```
